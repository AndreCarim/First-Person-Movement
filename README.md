This is a simple character movement and look using the new input system.

All you have to do is to make a new inputAction (right click/create/inputAction). If you dont see it, you need to download the new input system from unity (window/Package Manager/UnityRegistry/input System).

Once you created a new inputAction, double click on it and follow the picture bellow:
